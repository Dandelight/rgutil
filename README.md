# Utilities from Raymond Guo

This repository contains a set of Python utilities, written or collected, widely used and (hopefully) thoroughly tested, for the faster development of new [`torch`](https://pytorch.org/)-based projects.

The repository contains:

* `cvtv` package for `OpenCV`-based `torchvision` transformations, forked from <https://github.com/hityzy1122/opencv_transforms_torchvision/>.
* `log` package for `get_logger`.
